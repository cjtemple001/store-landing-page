The store landing page was designed with a clean, responsive layout, css framework (bootstrap) to ensure accessibility across all devices. A simple header was included for easy navigation, while the product section was arranged in a grid format for clarity and quick browsing. Visual hierarchy was achieved through bold headings, balanced spacing, and engaging product imagery. Finally, a minimal footer with essential links was added to maintain a professional look without overwhelming the user.
